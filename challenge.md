### **Challenges for Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns**

#### **1. Singleton Pattern**

- **Challenge**: Create a configuration manager for an application that ensures only one instance of the configuration object exists throughout the application's lifecycle.
- **Task**: Implement the Singleton pattern to manage the configuration object. Ensure that the configuration is loaded only once and can be accessed globally.

#### **2. Factory Pattern**

- **Challenge**: Build a simple UI component library (e.g., buttons, inputs, modals) where each component is created using a factory.
- **Task**: Use the Factory pattern to create different UI components based on the type passed to the factory.

#### **3. Observer Pattern**

- **Challenge**: Implement a notification system where multiple subscribers can listen to events (e.g., "newMessage", "userLoggedIn") and react accordingly.
- **Task**: Use the Observer pattern to allow components to subscribe to events and notify them when an event occurs.

#### **4. Decorator Pattern**

- **Challenge**: Create a text processing system where you can dynamically add formatting options (e.g., bold, italic, underline) to a text string.
- **Task**: Use the Decorator pattern to add formatting features to the text without modifying the core text class.

#### **5. Strategy Pattern**

- **Challenge**: Build a payment processing system that supports multiple payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal, cryptocurrency).
- **Task**: Use the Strategy pattern to encapsulate each payment method and allow the system to switch between them at runtime.

#### **6. Adapter Pattern**

- **Challenge**: Integrate a third-party analytics library that has a different interface than what your application expects.
- **Task**: Use the Adapter pattern to create a wrapper that makes the third-party library compatible with your application.

#### **7. Command Pattern**

- **Challenge**: Implement a remote control for a smart home system that can execute commands like turning lights on/off, adjusting thermostat settings, etc.
- **Task**: Use the Command pattern to encapsulate each action as an object and allow the remote control to execute and undo commands.

#### **8. Template Method Pattern**

- **Challenge**: Create a workflow for processing orders in an e-commerce application (e.g., validate order, process payment, ship order).
- **Task**: Use the Template Method pattern to define the skeleton of the workflow while allowing subclasses to override specific steps.

### **Challenges for SOLID Principles**

#### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

- **Challenge**: Refactor a monolithic `User` class that handles user authentication, profile management, and logging.
- **Task**: Split the `User` class into smaller classes, each with a single responsibility.

#### **2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

- **Challenge**: Build a discount system for an e-commerce application that can easily support new types of discounts (e.g., percentage-based, fixed-amount, seasonal).
- **Task**: Design the system so that it is open for extension (adding new discount types) but closed for modification.

#### **3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

- **Challenge**: Create a class hierarchy for shapes (e.g., `Rectangle`, `Square`, `Circle`) where each subclass can be used interchangeably without breaking the program.
- **Task**: Ensure that derived classes adhere to the behavior expected by the base class.

#### **4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

- **Challenge**: Design a set of interfaces for a multi-function printer that can print, scan, and fax.
- **Task**: Create separate interfaces for each functionality so that clients only depend on the interfaces they need.

#### **5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

- **Challenge**: Build a notification system that can send notifications via email, SMS, or push notifications.
- **Task**: Use dependency injection to decouple the notification logic from the specific notification channels.

### **Combined Challenges**

1. **E-Commerce System**:

   - Use the **Factory Pattern** to create different types of products.
   - Use the **Observer Pattern** to notify customers about product availability.
   - Apply the **Single Responsibility Principle** to separate product management, order processing, and payment handling.

2. **Game Development**:

   - Use the **Strategy Pattern** to implement different AI behaviors for game characters.
   - Use the **Decorator Pattern** to add power-ups or abilities to characters dynamically.
   - Apply the **Open/Closed Principle** to allow adding new character types without modifying existing code.

3. **Task Scheduler**:
   - Use the **Command Pattern** to encapsulate tasks as objects.
   - Use the **Template Method Pattern** to define a common workflow for task execution.
   - Apply the **Dependency Inversion Principle** to decouple task scheduling from task execution.

### **Tips for Success**

- Start with simple implementations and gradually add complexity.
- Write unit tests to ensure your design patterns and principles are correctly applied.
- Refactor your code to improve adherence to SOLID principles and design patterns.
